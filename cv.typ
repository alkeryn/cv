#work("Vozforge", "Founder and Software Engineer", "May 2020 - Now")[
    - Wrote an app that allows using an Android tablet as a graphic tablet on Windows and Linux,
        this involved writing drivers#cnt("w") and a custom TCP and UDP binary protocol from scratch.
        The server was initially written in *C++* and later rewritten in *Rust*, the client, running on the tablet,
        was written in *Kotlin*.
    - Writing a modular *Rust* backend framework using *Actix*, this includes modules and libraries for authentication, geospatial queries#cnt("w"), account management, messaging, notifications, and more,
        the databases used are *PostgreSQL*, *ScyllaDB*#cnt("w"), and *Redis*.
    - Wrote a visualization web UI to compare Google *S2* to Uber *H3* using WebAssembly

        + *KMDF* on Windows, libinput on Linux
        + Using Google S2 cells and ScyllaDB, the library allows for horizontally scalable realtime geospatial queries such as "getting 100 users in a radius of 100km ordered by distance"
        + ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of *CassandraDB* made by mostly the same people but with high performance as a goal.
